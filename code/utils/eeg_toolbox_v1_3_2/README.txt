EEG_TOOLBOX Readme
------------------

This is the EEG Toolbox, which we compiled from general scripts in use
in the Computational Memory Lab.


To Install
----------

This toolbox is a set of Matlab functions.  As such, you just have to
put them somewhere in your path and add it to your Matlab path.

The HTML documentation, which is just an easy way to browse around all
the functions, is available separately.  Just download it and point
your browser at it.
