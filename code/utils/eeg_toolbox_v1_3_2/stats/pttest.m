function [p, t, df] = pttest(d1, d2)
%PTTEST Student's paired t-test.
%       PTTEST(X1, X2) gives the probability that Student's t
%       calculated on paired data X1 and X2 is higher than
%       observed, i.e. the "significance" level. This is used
%       to test whether two paired samples have significantly
%       different means.
%       [P, T] = PTTEST(X1, X2) gives this probability P and the
%       value of Student's t in T. The smaller P is, the more
%       significant the difference between the means.
%       E.g. if P = 0.05 or 0.01, it is very likely that the
%       two sets are sampled from distributions with different
%       means.
%
%       This works for PAIRED SAMPLES, i.e. when elements of X1
%       and X2 correspond one-on-one somehow.
%       E.g. residuals of two models on the same data.
